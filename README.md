TypeScript is not just a language extension for JavaScript , it's a game changer for large-scale application development. In this blog post, we’ll dive into two important aspects that every developer using TypeScript should know:

# 1.What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

Interfaces are used to define the shape of an object while types can define more complex structures like unions and intersections.Another difference is interfaces can extend classes and interfaces while types can use intersections to extend.Interfaces are for only object-like structures while types can use primitive,tuples or unions. Overall, interfaces are better for defining object structures while types are more versatile.

# Example
# Interface
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

# Type
type PersonType = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    id: number ;
};

# 2. How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which significantly improves code quality and maintainability. 

# Static Typing
Typescript checks the code not only catches error at runtime but at compile time which catches the bugs earlier in  the development process.
The code is cleaner, easier to read,understand and maintain.The hints,autocompletion , hovering has inline documention which eases the mental load.Nonetheless, it has better support for refactoring while renaming variables,functions or classes.TypeScript is ideal for large projects with multiple developers.
It enforces consistent coding practices and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.Lastly, You can adopt TypeScript gradually in existing JavaScript projects. This flexibility allows teams to migrate without rewriting everything from scratch.
// TypeScript enforces type safety
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

// This will throw a compile-time error
// add("1", 2); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

TypeScript makes your code smarter, safer, and easier to maintain. By understanding how to use powerful tools like interface vs type, and by embracing its static typing, you not only catch bugs early but also build projects that scale with confidence.

Whether you're building a small app or a large system, TypeScript will always be on your side — helping you write clean, reliable, and future-proof code.
